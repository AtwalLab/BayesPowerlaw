# How to use the code

To run the Fit_Bayes code with given defaults:

    obj_name=Fit_Bayes(data)

where data is a list or array of numbers from 1 to infinity.


Defaults:

    gamma_range=[1,6] - so far the default prior is flat within the exponent range 1 to 6. Change the range by inputing your own numbers a and b: gamma_range=[a,b].

    xmin=1,xmax=np.infty - will fit the whole distribution. Rectrict the fit by inputing your own xmin and xmax, e.g. xmin=3,xmax=100.

    descrete=True - assumes that the distribution being fitted is discrete. If distribution is continuous change - discrete=False.

    niters=5000 - MCMC will perform 5000 iterations. Change to a desired number of iterations, e.g. niters=1000.

    sigma=0.05 - default variance for selecting step size from gaussian distribution during MCMC.
    
    burn_in=1000 - default number of iterations for burn in MCMC.
    
    
    
Getting the answers:

    obj_name.samples_gamma[0]
    
To get the best exponent take the mean of that.
To plot the posterior, histogram it!
